> ## BREAKING NEWS: Microsoft GitHub [just censored this project](https://twitter.com/UpEnd_org/status/1004292351643275264) from its Trending page

We were the #1 project and the #4 "developer" before they deleted us. [Maybe it was too embarrassing?](https://twitter.com/UpEnd_org/status/1004308027078578176)

We have not violated any terms of service.

Is this Microsoft GitHub's commitment to an open platform for all projects? Will this repo be deleted too? Will other projects that compete with Microsoft products or challenge its dominance be on the chopping block next?

# GitHub has sold us out. This is the GitHub Evacuation Center.

Sold out.

Some will go with the flow. Some look forward to the new overlords and their deep pockets.

But some believe deeply that the open source community needs an independent home. Some believe that the concentration of so much power in the hands of so few is antithetical not just to free and open software, but also to a free and just society. We, the contributors and stargazers of this project are such people. This project is for us. **Star this repo** to count yourself in. #resist



## so, what's the goal?

The immediate goal is to be a sort of **GitHub Evacuation Center.** A space for evacuees to declare their status (in **protest** to GitHub, Microsoft and the world). A space to learn or share **escape routes** — In the coming days we will collaboratively put together resources and guides on where best to move you and your projects and how.

Long term the goal is to seed a resistance movement for a free, open and people-driven internet in service of a free, open and people-driven world.
